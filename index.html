      <h4>Why Software Development?</h4> 
      <p>After completing a Python course in 2018, I became intruiguied about programming. 
        I was trying to decide what degree to do as I really enjoyed Chemistry as well as
        programming. However, since I could learn programming outside of a university-based
        setting, I decided to pursue Chemistry at university and continue programming as a 
        hobby. Furthermore, when researching into degrees and doing further research, I 
        came across a field called 'Cheminformatics', this field combines Chemistry and 
        Software Development together. Furthermore, during some of my modules at university,
        I learnt about this field even further in my final year. This fuelled me to start 
        applying to software based graduate schemes and courses.
